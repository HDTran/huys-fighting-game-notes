## What Will it Take
This is a hard question to answer because everyone will be different. I am not there yet, so I also cannot even say. This is my current working philosophy: figure out what questions I need to answer so I can sleep at night.

The questions I want to answer:
- Where will I be if I put 400 hours (or 8,000 Battles) into Ranked Matches? What if I could find the time to play?
- What if I actually practiced? Can I attain an execution level that I would be proud of?
- Eventually, can I do this with more characters more easily now that I'm at this new milestone?

None of these questions have value judgements. They also don't have destinations that are unreachable. It's just having the curiosity and putting in the work.
## How Do I Track Progress
I use the Tiny Experiments method outlined and written in Anne-Laure Le Cunff's book of the same name.

The core Tiny Experiments method:
- **Chunk learning by making smaller pacts.** If I look at the 400 hours of Ranked Matches I want to play, it will feel like an insurmountable amount. But if I chunk it down to 8 weeks of experimenting with whether I can keep up 140 Ranked Battles a week and then reevaluate, it becomes way more accomplishable.
- **Track my learning through Field Notes, Pluses, Minuses, and Next every week.** This is a simple log that also allows me to reflect every week so that I'm actually appreciating the time I have and learning the lessons I should.
- **Learn publicly.** So others can help, hold me accountable, or comment if they want.

I track this through a [template with my own example](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Q_5agiNiHpoL-I6nD_MUV55RdZs9yCANFLKooSNp4K0/edit?gid=1869908185#gid=1869908185) on Google Drive. I then [post](https://discord.com/channels/141680127196135424/1165493349910859847/1432480262591348807) this in the Discord group.
## Benchmarking from Other Players
A caveat before looking at the numbers below: Take comfort in growth over time. If it didn't take time and effort to grow, then that means that the ceiling has already been determined. We respect the amount of work that it takes and we all knew that it would be hard.

This is what hard looks like.

If we want to model ourselves based on the average curve of players, we can use the [charts provided by CatCammy](https://x.com/CatCammy6/status/1793022265380020667/photo/1) to figure out the ranges for goals.

Average Ranked Match Hours for MR in 2024:
- 1500-1600 MR: 200h (or 4,000 battles) ranked.
- 1600-1700 MR: 275h (or 5,500 battles) ranked.
- 1700-1800 MR: 350h (or 7,000 battles) ranked.
- 1800-1900 MR: 410h (or 8,200 battles) ranked.
- 1900-2000 MR: 400h (or 8,000 battles) ranked.
- 2000+ MR: 500h (or 10,000 battles) ranked.

Until we hit double those numbers (because of averages), it's really hard to say that any of us have hit our ceiling.

Another way to approach figuring out where to put your efforts is to model after popular players who are out there now. Here are the following breakdowns for top buckets of time with legendary players on October 28, 2025 according to their Buckler profile.
