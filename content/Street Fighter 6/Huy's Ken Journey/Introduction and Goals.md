These are actual notes that I've collected and worked in my brain when playing Ken. No more, no less. These are here as a record of what it took me.

There are a few core things to note about my journey that is relevant:
- I have the pleasure of being surrounded by great players who helped me grow every Thursday. Without putting in those hours with them and having a shared love for this game, I wouldn't have tried this. I've already learned how to play nuanced Street Fighter from playing with them on so many Thursdays.
- TODO: I'm over-indexed on BattleHub and Custom Room -- so the next part of my journey is fixing Ranked Matches and using Training Mode explicitly // start hours
- Finding the time to play is difficult. I typically only play games for 3 hours a week, which was Thursday. I had to carve out an additional 7 hours (or 2 nights) a week for this strategy to work.
