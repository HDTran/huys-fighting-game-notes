## Drive Damage Tests
- (fully blocked) (`DR cMP/DR sHP) xx DR sHP xx MK Jinrai xx LK Follow-up`. True block-string other than the LK follow-up, use 3 bars of drive for 1.5 bars of drive damage. If you can get `sHP` by itself without cancel or `sHP xx HK Jinrai` before starting this, the drive damage will be immense.
- In combo-routing, the only things that allow you to to go into a guaranteed Drive Impact on hit with Ken are heavy punches. So `sHP/cHP xx DI` will cost 1 drive bar to do 1 drive bar of damage. If you're ahead on drive or they only have 1 drive bar left, this is something to be extremely aware of so that you don't have to use Super Art meter. Remember that `SA1` is 0.5 drive bars of damage, `SA2` is 1 drive bar of damage, and `SA3` is 1.5 drive bars of damage on it.
## SA2 on -5 on Block or -1 on Burnout
- You can attack drive bar with a lot of resources: `DR sHP > sMP, HP xx DR sHP > sMP, HP xx OD Jinrai > HK,HK Followup xx SA2` for 3.8 drive bars of drive damage costing 5.1 drive bars. If they push a button during `sMP, HP xx DR sHP`, you will trade and you can score a hit of `sHP xx run, run Shoryuken (or others)`.
- `DR sHP > sMP, HP xx OD Jinrai xx HK,HK Followup xx SA2` costs 2.8 drive bars to do 2.9 drive bars of drive damage.
- Max chip damage in the corner when they're burnt out: `sMP xx OD Hadoken > sMP xx OD Hadoken > sLK xx OD Jinrai xx HK,HK Followup xx SA2 > OD Shoryuken`.
