## Okizeme Situations
### 25f Advantage
- sMP, HP xx run, run Shoryuken = 25f oki
- HP Shoryuken = 25f oki
Okizeme
- (whiff) c.LP > (usually blocked) s.HP > s.LP (invest more with xx Drive Rush s.LP)
### 26f Advantage
- sMP, HP xx MK Jinrai > HP Shoryuken = 26f oki
- sMP, HP xx MK Jinrai, delayed HK follow-up > HP Shoryuken = 26f-27f
Okizeme
- (see 25f routing)
### 28f Advantage
- Jinrai LK and MK > CH follow-up LK = 28f oki
TODO: Okizeme
- TODO: (whiff) s.MP > c.MP xx MK Jinrai, LK follow-up?
- forward dash > st.HP
- run > run overhead kick
- forward dash > forward throw (might need microwalk if they backroll)
- forward dash > microwalk back to avoid the throw for possible shimmy setup
- (corner) (whiff) st.LP > OD Hadoken is +2 on block, +6 on regular hit. It will also beat level 1 supers on OD Hadoken, so you can keep continuing with cr.HP when you Punish Counter them.
- (corner) (whiff) cr.LK > st.HP is 0 on block, +5 on regular hit 
### 32f Advantage
- sMK, MK, HK
TODO: Okizeme
### 33f/34f Advantage
Should I discard this route? I'm used to using it, but it does do less damage than the HP Shoryuken variants in the corner. It's good for creating baits though, so when you land, you can bait a whiffed s.MP and then walk back with more frames.
- c.MP xx LK Tatsumaki > MP Shoryuken = 33f
- sMP, HP xx MK Jinrai, delayed HK follow-up > MP Shoryuken = 33f-34f
- sMP, HP xx MK Jinrai > MP Shoryuken = 34f
TODO: Okizeme
### 36f Advantage
- Super Art 2 = 36f oki
Okizeme
- (corner) (whiff) s.LP > LP Hadouken? TODO: Test 
### 40f Advantage
- c.HK
Okizeme
- TODO
### 42f Advantage
This is the corner safe jump route.
- sMP, HP xx MK Jinrai = 42f oki.
- s.MP, HP xx run, run Dragonlash = 42f oki.
Okizeme
- (corner) safe j.HP for major advantage on block, TODO: test shimmy ability
- (corner) safe j.MK for minor advantage on block, but easier throw timing. TODO: test shimmy ability
- (corner) safe empty jump for low/throw mixup
- (corner) (whiff) s.MK > s.HP
- TODO: (corner) safe j.LK? , TODO: test shimmy ability
- TODO: (corner) safe j.HK, TODO: test shimmy ability
- two dashes > throw
- two dashes > c.LP
### 43f Advantage
- s.MP, HP xx run, run Tatsumaki = 43f oki
Okizeme
- (corner) Whiffed empty jump, you won't get a normal with it on block. So it's best to go for throw, s.LP, or c.LK.
- (whiff) s.LP xx run, run overhead > c.LP > s.MP, HP xx MK Jinrai, HK followup > HP Shoryuken
- (whiff) s.LP xx run, run stop > c.LK, s.LP, s.LP xx HP Shoryuken
- (whiff) s.LP xx run, run stop > throw

TODO: c.MK xx MK Hurricane Kick
## Okizeme Building Blocks
These moves should help construct new okizeme situations. Remember that if you can get the block situation such that it's +f because you're on the last active frame, that's a winner. Otherwise, you want to be able to mix between multiple options.
