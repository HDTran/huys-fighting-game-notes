- TODO: If you can shoot, shooting once or twice can get the Blanka thinking about  sliding. Keep putting in thoughts of what you might do to force unwanted moves.

## Cammy
- At Range 2.5+, if Cammy is going to travel across the screen, it's going to be Spin Knuckle or Hooligan Combination. Both can be beaten by jabs, conversion is different though.
- Cammy players are good at figuring out when to Cannon Strike, usually when you're walking back. TODO backwalking uppercuts
- TODO
## Chun-Li
- Chun's jump time from normal jumps and how the screen shifts vertically when she goes up provides a good tell for anti-airs. If she crosses you up with her df+HK (Falling Crane), crosscut it.
- Chun's light fireball goes about 2 character ranges away before it disappates. A good way to fight her is to backdash/walk back into the disappate range and then prepare to check her if she walks in thinking she still has the shield to block you.

## Jamie
- Jamie's space traps are built in, don't push buttons after most moves--it's a setup. Because of Jamie's confidence in space traps and pushing buttons, checks can come easily too. Do not drive rush to try to cheat neutral.

## Luke

## Mai
- If Mai shoots an OD fan to get the overhead tick on you very close, instead of walking back and dealing with the mixup, you can block and walk forward instead
- If you attempt to PP Mai's fans and miss, it's oftentimes still good to hold the parry if you're worried about the overhead/low mix when she's driving forward. If you're worried about throws when she's driving forward, release and throw tech instead.

## Marisa
- Marisa is very weak to anti-air. If you jump with a deep vertical button or an empty jump from far away such that her anti-air cHP will whiff, you can likely get your offense started. Some Marisas are keen on watching out for AA situations more, using air-to-air and other tools. Figure out if the Marisa you're playing is one of those or not and at least force her to know that you might jump by testing it. So the following breakdowns are useful:
	- If Marisa isn't able to stop your jumps, play around with ranges and entries to force her to stress about it.
	- If Marisa is watching for air-to-air, fake jumps by pumping crouch (and returning to neutral) at ideal jump ranges to make her think you're about to jump.

## Rashid
- When you block Rashid's stHP, it's good to try to perfect parry the Tornado to stop him from setting up on you.
- Despite Rashid's angles jumping from afar or over, he's susceptible top anti-air.
- A lot of Rashid players have not trained crosscut, especially because his motion is a quarter-circle. Abuse cross-ups more.
- TODO
## Ryu
- If you walk and force him to whiff a Solar Plexus, punish with a long-ranged normal accordingly.
- If you are trying to parry his Hadokens, hold down the parry in the case that he fakes it with a whiffed Hasogeki. If it's whiffed, drive rush forward with a jab to interrupt him from throwing your parry.
- Misplaced LK or MK High Blade Kicks (aka Donkey Kicks) can be punished by long-ranged 11f (LK) and 8f (MK) moves on block. Figure out your character's 8f longest-range button and use it if you know the spacing is wrong. (e.g. Ken can punish these on block with sMK,MK,HK).
