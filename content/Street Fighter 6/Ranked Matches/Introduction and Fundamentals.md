## Having a Game Plan for Matchups
There is a clear difference between a player that heads into a matchup thinking about what plan they're going to execute and one that doesn't have one at all.

These are the things I'm working with:
- Recount anti-character matchup notes in my head when I see the character appear on the challenger screen. See [[Matchups]].
- Have a set of questions that I want to answer for my own character (or in general) before I start. Specific ones to such as what the enemy will wakeup with after Ken's corner carry to what will an opponent do when I execute a Jinrai on block. General ones such as will they let me jump in on them. Will they throw tech proactively? See [[Ken Player Checks]].
- Have a set of questions that I want to answer from my opponent's character. Are they this type of player who does this with their character? What will they abuse? What will they put on the table.

With this simple framework, there's an intention to approach every match with a plan, but still be nimble.

## Reducing Rank Importance of Opponents and Managing Long Sessions
We intrinsically know that points don't matter. Whether they're League Points (LP) or Master Rate (MR), it's just a number that goes up and down. However, we've all been trained by society to do well in school and compete. That's healthy in ways and unhealthy in others.

If we look at the best players in [[Goal Setting#Benchmarking from other players]], we understand that it takes many battles and hours to get there. And realistically, we wouldn't have it any other way because if it was any other way, the ceiling would be capped solely by "innate talent" versus dedication and hard work. So the answer to getting better is to play, even if playing isn't easy.

For me, the tactics that have actually worked making playing ranked easier:
- Use Street Fighter 6's HUD to hide displaying ranks. Underestimating or overestimating your opponents is one of the deadliest things that can affect your play. When you play in-person, there is no magical rank that floats over their heads, so just remove it. Everyone you play deserves the same level of respect.
- Remember that your own rank and number is only where it's at if you stop playing. There is no such thing as actual failure. And its' value is only what you give it, so celebrate the victories and forgive yourself when you're down. Growth takes adversity and this is what hard looks like. If it wasn't hard, it wouldn't be worth the effort.
- Count the number of battles you've played in the current session rather than wins/losses. Set goals to hit a battle count rather than to keep playing until you're up (or recovering from being down) on points. I keep a stack of poker chips that I move from one stack to the next, converting 1s to 5s and 25s. The act of just counting and seeing a number go up rewires the monkey brain from caring too much about the in-game numbers. It's healthy to set a goal before the session so that you know when you're stopping. If you hit your goal, you can decide to go for another limited amount of battles or just switch to practice/training.
## Neutral Skips
All fighting games are built around some sort of neutral skipping, character-specific movement, and ranges. That is a fact of character differences to core game mechanics. How you deal with them defines your play style and expression in the game.

At the beginning, learning how to neutral skip will get many victories. Similarly, using all of our resources will secure us many victories. But as we get better, we learn nuance to when we should use resources and when we should use neutral skips.

In the Master Rate grind, we'll feel these even more:
- Burning out early is deadly and can lead to immediate checkmating.
- Drive Rush is a lot less powerful than before, with many able to check you.
- Any "stops" (such as a Drive Rush Check, Anti-Air, or OD Reversal) sends a dramatic message.

This means that the value of meter-less combos, character positioning, and anti-airs become even more important.

The goal then is to solidify using them and introducing more variation and taking less risks. For example, simply moving quickly left/right with your character repeatedly can trigger people awaiting dashes and Drive Rushes, giving you an opportunity to mask your movement. So use the understanding of the [Green, Yellow, and Red Zones and human reactions](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=14z6CN3q-Nw) appropriately.
## Visualization and Categorizing Opponent + Tuning Through Jargon
One of the things we all do as players is to categorize opponents when we face them in a set. We all do this subconsciously. However, if we do this consciously, it opens up solutions that we wouldn't normally take, allowing us to exceed the expectations of the opponent and ourselves. 

I recategorize players every new set with the following jargon:
- When playing the footsies triangle: protect, sway, approach.
	- **Protect.** Checking with a move to stop someone from walking forward, usually at max confident range.
	- **Sway.** Walking backward to create space for a whiffed move and then punishing it. Note that the #1 reason many players who walk backward lose is that they don't look for a whiff and get cornered for giving away the space for free. That's why the word here is "sway."
	- **Approach.** Walking forward to close space and potentially make a move.
- When playing defense: block, parry, reverse.
	- **Block.** Lowest risk play when on defense, waiting for the turn to be over.
	- **Parry.** Medium risk play, trying win defense or conserve drive without major risk other than throw (or Drive Impact when recovering).
	- **Reverse.** High risk play, not letting the opponent take a real turn (or a turn with gaps).
- When playing timing: immediate, slightly/counter-hitting (aka. counter: slightly delayed, looking for interrupt), heavy/whiff-punishing (aka: reposte: heavily delayed, looking for whiff).
	- **Immediate.** Keeping your offense tight with low-risk, but obvious timing.
	- **Slight/Counter-Hitting.** Taking slight risk to introduce variance for people who just Block.
		- A drill useful for training delayed buttons is using the [[Delayed Drive Rush Offense]] because you're in an advantaged situation.
	- **Heavy/Whiff-Punishing.** Taking higher risk with loose footsies at neutral for enemies who are very active, but the least obvious timing.
		- A drill useful for training whiff punishing at the expert level is [[Delayed Whiff Punish Option Select]] because you're able to fish out medium normals and spacing.

If we look at the above as sliders, the over-conservative style of play is protect footsies, block defense, and immediate timing. The most aggressive style of play is approach, reverse on block, and heavy/whiff-punishing.

The way we get into Master Rank is usually prioritizing the following sliders: sway, block, and immediate. But the way we Master Grind is to become loose with all of the sliders and not always use this inclination. Where we prioritize is our play style and determines whether we enhance our character's strengths or cover our character's weaknesses in every given moment.
