Some M. Bison players are aggressive with Knee Press, often doing it when their positioning isn't safe. You can encode this because the telegraphed sounds/animations of the Knee Presses are different and respond accordingly.
## Settings
- **Vitality Recovery Settings (P1 and P2).** Standard (no refill).
- **Block.** Block All.
- **Dummy Behavior.**  Crouch.
- **Block Reversal Slots.** Do Nothing, Light Knee Press, Medium Knee Press, Heavy Knee Press.
- **Position**. Corner of the screen, cornering opponent.
## Drill
- **Exercise.** Initiate with your medium to long-ranged normal like `cMP`. When it is blocked, Bison will react in these ways. Hold `db` and react accordingly.
	- If he does nothing, do nothing and reinitiate.
	- If he does `HK Knee Press`, do nothing and walk/dash/Drive Rush him back into the corner.
	- If he does `LK/MK Knee Press`, punish him with a 4f/5f combo accordingly.
- **Sets/reps.** 5 health bars from the left and then 5 health bars from the right in one set.
- **Expanding.** You can expand this drill with a cash out combo at the end of the health bar to kill. Reset if you're wrong.
## Proper Form
- The animation of the Light Knee Press is very fast, the "Nin" sound from the Medium Knee Press helps recognize it, and the Heavy Knee Press where you shouldn't push has a different sound too.
