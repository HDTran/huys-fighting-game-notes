## What about combo practice
Combo practice is important in any fighting game. Where Street Fighter 6's combo mastery lies though is knowing the situation 

The essential combos:
- **Jab confirm combo.** Whenever you get a jab, what is the meter-less follow-up?
- **All-resource combo.** Whenever you can kill, do you know how to route to using all of your drive meter and Super Art 3 to finish someone off?
- **Drive impact combo.** Whenever you land a drive impact, do you know what combo to use before your opponent falls over?
- **Long-ranged drive rush combo.** When you're battling in neutral and throwing out a medium or heavy button, do you have a combo that you can buffer Drive Rush behind and confirm?
- **Oki-setup combo.** Do you have a combo where you trade damage to get another chance of keeping your turn and putting them into a mixup?
- **Corner-carry combo.** If you need to push your opponent into the corner, do you have a combo that pushes them further than others?

Advanced combos incorporate more factors such as mid-combo resets (usually into a Drive Rush overhead or corner Drive Impact), corner escape, using super arts 1 and 2, drive damage, whether you can kill, safe jump setups, corner-only damage optimizations, and more. As you play your character longer and the above standard combos get ingrained, you should keep branching out as a player.

Asking yourself what is optimal for yourself and valuing the eventual matrix of the different factors between your combos is a part of your own play style and creative expression.

- What are you getting hit by?
- Did you convert your hits optimally?
- What are you repeatedly doing that didn't work?
	- TODO: drive rushing and getting checked
	- TODO: If you're constantly walking back and your opponent never whiffs a button and keeps approaching, you should probably stop walking back
- What are buttons you aren't hitting? What moves aren't you using?
- Are you always low on resources most of the match?
- Are you still doing what your character should be good at? Are those strengths coming out against matchups?

This refinement of training strategy is what makes players different, so forge your own path.
