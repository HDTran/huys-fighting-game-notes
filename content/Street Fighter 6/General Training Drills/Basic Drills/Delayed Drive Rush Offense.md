This drill is good for breaking your opponent's guard in the following situations:
- You read that they're using throw-tech or jabs after blocking during a Drive Rush and want to pull them out.
- You've created a sequence where they've blocked a lot of moves (usually 3+ blocked hits), so they now want to push a button to take back their turn. This happens often at the end of a match, near the depletion of the opponent's Drive Gauge, and/or close to the corner.
- You can feel that they've tightened up their guard and that you're both hesitating and waiting in neutral, but you don't want to risk Drive Rushing into a throw. This happens often at the end of a match.

You should not use this drill if the opponent is trained to always OD Reversal or Super Art when you Drive Rush a normal on them.
## Settings
- **Vitality Recovery Settings (P1 and P2).** Standard (no refill).
- **Block.** Block All.
- **Dummy Behavior.**  Crouch.
- **Block Reversal Slots.** Forward Throw (Delay: 5F), Forward Throw (Delay: 8F). (These delay windows create the fastest and slowest bound time you should attempt this.)
- **Position**. Corner of the screen, cornering opponent.
## Drill
- **Exercise.** Initiate with your long-ranged normal cancelled into a delayed Drive Rush normal to catch the throw tech. Example of this is Ken's `cMK xx (delayed) Drive Rush cMP`. Then continue the combo on hit. Initiate again until they're dead and adjust your follow-up combos accordingly. Reset if you're wrong.
- **Sets/reps.** 20 health bars from the left and then 20 health bars from the right in one set.
- **Expanding.** You can expand this drill by doing a corner carry for your first combo, a corner combo, a cash out combo to kill, etc. Reset if you're wrong.
## Proper Form
- When choosing the normal to cancel into a Drive Rush, I recommend choosing the most likely button you're going to use the most like a character's `cMK` at mid-range (or `cMP` if they don't have a cancelable `cMK`).
- When choosing the normal to Drive Rush into, I recommend picking one that leaves you that allows you to continue the combo and to get a frame trap if they're mashing jabs the entire time. A good example of this is Ken's `Drive Rush cMP` that puts him +4F on block, allowing him to go into `sMP/cMP` for a follow-up combo on hit or frame trap a light/throw-tech on block.
