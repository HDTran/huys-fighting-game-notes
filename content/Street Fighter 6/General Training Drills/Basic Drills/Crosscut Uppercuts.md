This uppercut training is good for keeping people in the corner as well as rewiring your brain to prioritize follow-up actions when throws get jumped. This training is specifically for uppercuts executed with the Dragon-punch/Shoryuken motion (`f, d, d/f`).
## Set up
- **Health.** Standard (no refill).
- **Block.** Block all.
- TODO ???. Standing.
- **Wakeup reversal slots.** Forward Jump, Vertical Jump.
- **Position**. Corner of the screen, cornering opponent.
## Drill
- **Exercise.** Initiate with throwing the opponent. Then go up for a throw loop throw (even if your character doesn't have one either by walking, drive rushing, or dashing based on character). Then crosscut uppercut the forward jump or forward uppercut the neutral jump. Reset if you miss even a single one.
	- If it's a crosscut uppercut, allow the dummy to do whatever jump they will on wakeup, jump over them/dash under them and push them into the corner again. Reinitiate with a throw.
	- If it's a forward uppercut, immediately whiff two throws after to get ready for the next jump rotation. You may need to manually wait here or frame kill if you want to get the timing perfect based on the character.
- **Sets/reps.** 20 health bars from the left and then 20 health bars from the right in one set. It took me about 8-12 hours over multiple sets to get it right in SF6 to finally be able to see me using this in real battles.
- **Expanding.** You can expand this drill by ending it with an OD Uppercut or Super Art when it will you think it will kill instead. Reset if you're wrong.
## Proper Form
- Crosscut uppercuts in SF6 should be inputed in the following: `f, df, d, db`. Remember that the `f` input isn't just for the Shoryuken (dp) motion, but to actually reposition a little bit so you're a bit under. You want to be inputting `d, db` while they're jumping over. Hold into the `db` at the end of the motion as if you were holding `df` at the end of a Shoryuken. The input window in SF6 for this is large, so getting used to inputting during a throw whiff gives a good amount of time and game feel.
- Forward uppercuts should be done with `f, d, df`. You want to get used to starting with `f` (instead of `df`) for these. It seems like it would be the right way to go for optimization of crouching, but you'll need the forward feel to quickly react to when you're approaching from your offense and dealing with a jump. (This is a key difference from a charging character with a `d,u` charge reversal like Guile where you want to get used to throwing with `df` and holding `df`, so you don't want to mess up your rewiring if you're considering that).
- Holding `df` (or `db` for crosscut) at the end of your input is a good way to feel completion of the motion and will help the input reader register the special move.
