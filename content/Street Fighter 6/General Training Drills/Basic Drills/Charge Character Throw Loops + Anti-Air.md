With charge characters, throwing after a whiffed throw is very awkward. This drill is good for making charge reversals doable when a throw whiffs. The way to rewire this is to initiate throws with df+LP+LK or throw tech with db+LP+LK instead.

TODO: Same exercise as Crosscut Uppercuts, but "throw loop" with df+LP+LK.
