I think of these as two different drills, but they've been grouped here because the settings are exactly the same. This uppercut training is good for those who have gotten used to jumping on you when you're walking backwards or crouching, including those who neutral jump to try to bait your throw whiff when the knockdown time is longer.

Make sure to pick a character with a standard jump time (most of the cast) at 45F. I like using Sagat because his animation has specifically always felt heavy like I shouldn't try to anti-air him even though the time is the same. Do not use characters that have slower jumps like Chun-Li. You can check for [jumping frames on Fullmeter in the jumping tab](https://fullmeter.com/fatonline/#/framedata/SF6/Chun-Li).
## Settings
- **Vitality Recovery Settings (P1 and P2).** Standard (no refill).
- **Block.** Block All.
- **Dummy Behavior.** Standing.
- **Wakeup Reversal Slots.** Forward Jump.
- **Block Reversal Slots.** Forward Jump.
- **Position**. Middle of the screen.
## Drill
- **Exercise.** Initiate with hitting the blocking opponent with a long-ranged attack like `cMK`. Then uppercut the opponent and repositioning relative to the enemy so that you're backwalking or crouching again during the next jump when they wake up. You want to nail the anti-air as late and deep as possible because it'll give you more okizeme time (to Drive Rush, dash, or walk forward afterward) in match. Reset if you're wrong.
	-  If it's a backwalking uppercut, I often had to walk forward and to be able to walk backward during the next uppercut.
	- If it's a crouching uppercut, I walked to the position where the jump would be caught and just crouched.
- **Sets/reps.** 20 health bars from the left and then 20 health bars from the right in one set.
- **Expanding.** You can expand this drill by ending it with an OD Uppercut or Super when it will you think it will kill instead. Reset if you're wrong. You can also expand this drill by adding a Do Nothing Slot or more Forward Jump slots with different Delay timings to make it harder. Reset if you're wrong. I haven't personally done this because I just jam quickly through this drill to fix my form.
## Proper Form
  - For backwalking uppercuts, the input you want your hand to get used to going from `b` and then either `f, d, df` or `df, d, df`. This is based on your controller. Pad and leverless is easier with `f, d, df`. Stick can do either, but I do prefer the `df, d, df`.
  - For crouching uppercuts, the input you want your hand to get used to is going from either `db` then `df, d, df` because you want your character to crouch the entire time, making it harder for you to get hit by jumps.
  - Holding `df` at the end of your input is a good way to feel completion of the motion and will help the input reader register the special move.
