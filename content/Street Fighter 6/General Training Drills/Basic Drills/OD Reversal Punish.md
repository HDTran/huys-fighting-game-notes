This training is good for encoding your system to react to OD Reversals that are blocked or whiffed with the proper punish. If you add variable punishes based on the location on the screen or resource use, it can train situational punishes well too.

I recommend picking a character with a standard OD Reversal move such as Luke or Ryu so that you train punishing them on while they land.
## Settings
- **Vitality Recovery Settings (P1 and P2).** Standard (no refill).
- **Block.** Block All.
- **Dummy Behavior.** Crouch.
- **Wakeup Reversal Slots.** OD Reversal (Luke's OD Rising Uppercut or Ryu's OD Shoryuken). Set a Delay if the combo you're using puts you too far from being able to punish it again.
- **Block Reversal Slots.** OD Reversal (Luke's OD Rising Uppercut or Ryu's OD Shoryuken).
- **Position**. Middle of the screen.
## Drill
- **Exercise.** Initiate with a safe blocked normal like `cMP`. When you block the OD Reversal, do the punish combo you want to encode. Try to be close enough after your combo so that you can punish the next one and repeat this until their health bar is depleted. Reset if you're wrong.
- **Sets/reps.** 20 health bars from the left and then 20 health bars from the right in one set.
- **Expanding.** You can expand this drill by doing a corner carry for your first combo, a corner combo, a cash out combo to kill, etc. Reset if you're wrong. You can also expand this drill by using different characters that propel forward--DeeJay and Juri can be difficult for some punishes to land given their forward momentum or animation landing.
## Proper Form
- You should always respond to Drive Impact with your Drive Impact button without shifting your hand. This gives you the fastest response time in real battle. For most people, this is going to be the "4P" button (often L1 on a stick or leverless controller) with your pinky. If you shift your hand to use your other fingers or you use two fingers to do `HP+HK`, restart.
## Ken Expansion with Run Tatsumaki
1. On first OD Reversal mid-screen: `Run, run Tatsumaki > sMP, HP xx run, run Tatsumaki > dash forward > dash forward`.
2. On first OD Reversal in corner: `Run, run Tatsumaki > sMP xx Drive Rush cHP xx run, run stop sMP xx Drive Rush cHP xx run, run stop sMP, HP xx run, run Shoryuken xx SA3`.
