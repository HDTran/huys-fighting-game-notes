This training is good for encoding your system to react to Drive Impact by training your visual and audio cues as well as your reaction after getting the Drive Impact. If you add variable punishes based on the location on the screen or resource use, it can train situational punishes well too.
## Settings
- **Simple Training Settings.** Drive Impact Defense Practice. (We set this first so that we get Ryu with the recorded Drive Impact recordings.)
- **Vitality Recovery Settings (P1 and P2).** Standard (no refill). (Change this after the above.)
- **Position**. Middle of the screen.
## Drill
- **Exercise.** Wait and respond to Drive Impact with your Drive Impact button. If you ever hit Drive Impact incorrectly as a non-reaction, reset.
- **Sets/reps.** 20 health bars from the left and then 20 health bars from the right in one set.
- **Expanding.** You can expand this drill by doing a corner carry for your first combo, a corner combo, a cash out combo to kill, etc. Reset if you're wrong.
## Proper Form
- You should always respond to Drive Impact with your Drive Impact button without shifting your hand. This gives you the fastest response time in real battle. For most people, this is going to be the "4P" button (often L1 on a stick or leverless controller) with your pinky. If you shift your hand to use your other fingers or you use two fingers to do `HP+HK`, restart.
