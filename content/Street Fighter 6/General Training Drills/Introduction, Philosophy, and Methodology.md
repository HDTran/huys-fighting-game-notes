Training drills are great for the following reasons:
- We can quickly repeat situations and learn it, encoding it to our play.
- It's a very low-stress and easy way to play, allowing you to have fun with the game without the need of an opponent or intense match.
- It is common in every other craft or art that exists, so don't neglect it!

Use practice time accordingly.
## How to Not Get Bored in Training Mode
The easiest way to get bored in training mode is by using it for only combos or having no goals.

Ways of making it more interesting:
- Set up the drill up properly so that it's a mini-game with success/failure states. For example, setting the health bar to not refill, allowing the game to get to an end state is a core lever I use for designing a drill.
- Have an end goal of reps and sets (or a timer) so that you have a limited window of training. Then track the number of successful health bars depleted so you've gotten so that you feel progress (I use poker chips for this).
- Set goals of what you're trying to learn explicitly before you train.

Get comfortable with Training Mode and it can end up being fun.
## Designing Offensive and Defensive Combination Drills
One way to make drills multifaceted is by combining a defensive drill with an offensive drill. This also gives you easier ways to create reps/sets.

For example, if you wanted to build out a drill to top-off Drive Impact Defense and also work on new combos, you might want to control it in this way:
1. Start the standard [[Drive Impact Defense]] in the mid-screen.
2. On first Drive Impact counter, do a specific corner carry combo.
3. On cornered Drive Impact counter, do another specific corner combo.
4. On final Drive Impact counter, do a max-resource combo.

This keeps the defensive drill entertaining and doubles you up on training different skills.
## How to Effectively Record SF6 Actions
On the recording tab, enable "On First Input" and set the "Countdown" to 5 so that you can tighten up recordings and do them more easily!

Determine whether you need to recording the dummy approaching. If so, reset the positioning to mid-screen before you record it. If not, reset the positioning to corner/cornered before you record it. Remember that the reset controls for positioning are as follows:
- Touchpad = mid-screen
- Up+Touchpad = reversed-mid-screen
- Right+Touchpad = corner-right-screen
- Up+Right+Touchpad = reversed-corner-right-screen
- Right+Touchpad = corner-left-screen
- Up+Right+Touchpad = reversed-corner-left-screen
## How Many Reps and Sets
The science of training is long and studied through many crafts and professions.

Philosophical data-points that I use:
- Bruce Lee has been quoted saying, "I fear not the man who has practiced 10,000 kicks once, but I fear the man who has practiced one kick 10,000 times." I'm not as lofty as him, but I understand that getting through my encoding phase of 1,000 good reps is just the beginning. Topping it off and using it in matches to eventually get to 10,000 times is the goal.
- Olympic Fencer and Medalist Ibtihaj Muhammad noted in her memoir that during high school, they would train 3 hours a day, 6 days a week. It's incredible and humbling that even at the stakes of high school and with one season of training that the targets are like that. If I'm unwilling to train even a little bit, am I actually going to be able to answer the questions I have set out for myself?
- Steph Curry shoots 500 3-Pointers every single day. Whatever we may think, that's greatness fueled by hard work in one of the most competitive sports in the world.
- [Motor programs and Schmidt's Schema Theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Motor_program). Reaction time is created by phases of learning.

If we observe the above stories and theories, we can break down learning in the following steps:
1. **Drilling the skill to learn it with your hands.** Until your hands are comfortable with the motion, you're drilling the skill to get your hands right. Without this, you won't be able to encode the skill to respond to situations appropriately. Before Master Rank, we oftentimes drill only to get to the end of this phase.
2. **Encoding the skill for use.** Next, we need to automatically recognize the situations where the skill is useful so that we can apply it. This is an essential period for defensive drills. Familiarity with this phase will eventually lead to in-game use. In Master Rank, we should drill to get to the end of this phase because we're trying to make all of our moves as extensions to ourselves. If we don't, we're better served by shortcutting a little with Modern (and even then, they have different encoding to do at higher ranks). Here, I'm trying to hit the goal of 1,000 good reps even though I often get to using the skill way before I'm done. Maybe I should tweak it down, I'm not sure. You should tune yourself to whatever you feel is a good encoding phase.
3. **Topping off the skill so off so it doesn't get forgotten.** How often should we repeat the drill regularly so that it remains in our toolbox? Some skills we'll use so often in actual battle that we potentially may not need to do this anymore. Figuring out the need (or not) is the beauty of understanding and attuning to ourselves. Eventually, the goal is 10,000 good reps through topping it off and actual use.

To determine reps and sets, I use the following:
- I set the health bar to standard, no refill. How many reps depletes one health bar?
- How many health bars can I deplete in 15m or 30m? This will determine the set. A very standard amount I use is a set of 20 health bars from 1P and 20 health bars from 2P in one set when primarily training combo damage. If I train a defensive drill that has a lot of negative states (such as Do Nothing), I may only do 5 health bars from 1P and 5 health bars from 2P in one set.

Then on a weekly basis, I target getting the appropriate amount of sets in. And I track the total number of sets (given how many good reps are in each one) to figure out when a skill should get out of the encoding phase.

Example: If I was doing combo training and it takes 3 combos to deplete a health bar, and I can deplete 20 health bars in 30 minutes from 1P and 2P sides, I would say that 1 set is equal to `3 combos x 20 health bars` or 60 reps. If my encoding goal is 1,000 good reps, that means `1000 good reps / 60 reps per set`  or 17 sets (rounded from 16.67) that I want to accomplish with this drill before I potentially move it into top-off phase. During the encoding phase, I would try to get at least 1 set in per week.
## How Many Drills Should We Juggle and How Much Should We Train
I'm still trying to figure this out. At this point, I'm trying to get many drills to the top-off point so that my standard toolbox is larger.

The drills I'm juggling right now:
- **Figure out two skills I'm encoding for use.** This is where I'm trying to get to 1,000 reps over time. I'm trying to do 1-2 sets of these per week and adding it to the tracker. Currently in encoding:
	- [[Drive Impact Defense + Corner Jinrai Loops]]. Bringing back Drive Impact Defense, but also training Corner Jinrai Loops for offense. This will eventually enter top off phase.
	- [[Run Tatsumaki > sLP xx Run Okizeme Rotations 1 (Overhead) and 2 (Low)]]. Tighten up my okizeme rotations after sLP xx Run from Run Tatsumaki.
- **Top off with defensive essentials.** I am a player who feels more confident when I get my stops, so I prioritize them accordingly. I'm able to get enough time to do a set of these every week. Sometimes I get a second set. Currently in the rotation:
	- [[Crosscut Uppercuts]]
	- [[Backwalking and Crouching Uppercuts]]
- **Warm up with one offensive set of combos and/or okizeme situation.** This is generally what I'm doing in Training Mode either before playing or in-between Ranked Matches if I'm matching from Training Mode.

I'm eagerly awaiting for those two skills I'm encoding to enter top-off stage. Then I can proceed with focusing on more advanced defensive drills or character specific drills (especially Ryu right now).

In terms of how much should we train, this is a personal ratio that all players figure out on their own. See [[Goal Setting#Benchmarking from Other Players]] for examples!
## What About Combo Practice
Combo practice is important in any fighting game. Where Street Fighter 6's combo mastery lies is knowing the situation and optimizing whether we're aiming to conserve resources, use resources, change screen positioning, etc. That's how our play style and player expression is defined.

The essential combos:
- **Jab Confirm Combo.** Whenever you get a jab, what is the meter-less follow-up?
- **All-Resource/Cash Out Combo.** Whenever you can kill, do you know how to route to using all of your drive meter and Super Art 3 to finish someone off?
- **Drive Impact Combo.** Whenever you land a drive impact, do you know what combo to use before your opponent falls over?
- **Long-Range Drive Rush Combo.** When you're battling in neutral and throwing out a medium or heavy button, do you have a combo that you can buffer Drive Rush behind and confirm?
- **Oki-Setup Combo.** Do you have a combo where you trade damage to get another chance of keeping your turn and putting them into a mixup? To get a safejump?
- **Corner-Carry Combo.** If you need to push your opponent into the corner, do you have a combo that pushes them further than others?

Advanced combos incorporate more factors such as mid-combo resets (usually into a Drive Rush overhead or corner Drive Impact), corner escape, using super arts 1 and 2, drive damage, whether you can kill, safe jump setups, corner-only damage optimizations, and more. As you play your character longer and the above standard combos get ingrained, you should keep branching out as a player.

Asking yourself what is optimal for yourself and valuing the eventual matrix of the different factors between your combos is a part of your own play style and player expression.
## What About Frame Traps, Space Traps, and Okizeme
Training mode can accomplish this easily by setting the On Block responses! Make sure to use this to come up with offensive sequences.

Refer to these examples:
- [[Delayed Whiff Punish Option Select]]
- [[Run Tatsumaki > sLP xx Run Okizeme Rotations 1 (Overhead) and 2 (Low)]]
## What Should I Train Next
The way that I've been approaching it is through the following framework in this order:
1. What am I getting hit by?
2. What am I repeatedly doing that doesn't work?
3. What am I forced to block that I could have stopped?
4. Did I convert my hit optimally?
5. Am I always low on resources most of the match? How can I use more meterless offensive sequences or combos?
6. Am I still doing what my character should be good at? How can I enhance those? Are those strengths coming out against others?
7. Am I covering what my character is weak at? How can I cover those? How can I avoid those situations.
8. What buttons or special moves am I not using at all? Can I figure out a use for them?

This refinement of training strategy is what makes players different, so it's up to us forge our own path.
