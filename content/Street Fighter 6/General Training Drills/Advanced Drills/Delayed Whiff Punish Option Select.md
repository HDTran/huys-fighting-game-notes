TODO: clean this up

- Set Ryu to crouching, block 1, health standard (no refill).,
- Add these block reversal options: cMP, cMK (8f here is an important minimum), Do Nothing.,
- Initiate with sLP (or your character's main light poke).,

Then hold d/b for 8f-12f minimum, then do your whiff-punish punish button. Ken would be cMK, Bison would be cMP, etc. into a combo you would normally use for whiff punish. If you do it right:

- When you are in-range of the button, you will block and no button will come out.,
- When you are out of range of the button, you will hit/whiff punish.,
- When they do nothing, you shouldn't push a button.,
- Alternate looking for cMK and cMP. When you are looking for cMK, stand at tip range of sLP. When you are looking for cMP, stand within the cMK range when initiating with sLP, but outside cMP range (so that you're also training the block of cMK if it comes out).,

Do this for X health bars from 1P side and then X health bars from 2P side in the center of the screen. Reset if you have the wrong response during the health bar and start over.
