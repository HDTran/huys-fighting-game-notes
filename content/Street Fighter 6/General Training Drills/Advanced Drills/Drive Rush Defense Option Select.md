TODO: clean this up

1. Pick your character with an invincible OD special (such as Ken with OD Shoryuken). Pick Cammy.,
2. Set health to standard (not refill).,
3. Record Cammy (use midscreen position so that you can position the walk properly):
    
    - Slot 1: `walk c.MK xx Drive Rush s.LP > throw`: Respond with OD special, block, and then immediate throw tech (S3 change) or delayed throw tech (you can die to shimmy) => Note that Bison, Blanka, Cammy, Chun-Li, and Ryu can still shimmy you with c.MK xx Drive Rush c.LP or s.LP in S3 at standard ranges.,
    - Slot 2: `walk c.MK xx Drive Rush throw`: Respond with OD special.,
    - Slot 3: `walk c.MK`: Respond with nothing.,
    - (optional, but provides DI option) Slot4: `walk c.MK xx Drive Impact`: Respond with Drive Impact counter.,
    - (optional, Cammy does this a lot and getting used to inputting it before c.HP lands can be helpful) Slot 5: `walk c.MK xx Drive Rush c.HP > throw`: Respond with OD special. You can replace Slot 2 with this too.,
    - (optional) Slot 6: `walk c.MK xx Drive Rush s.LP, s.LP, s.LK`: Respond with OD special, block, and then do nothing.,
    
    ,
4. Play all slots of actions and respond accordingly until the health bar goes to 0. The sequence after blocking a c.MK should be OD Reversal > block > throw tech. And no matter what decisions you make, it should be correct. The OD reversal won't come out if Cammy does a true block string with Drive Rush c.LP or s.LP. Don't always do this obviously in a real match because people can go invincible on you and certain S3 characters can still shimmy you. If you don't respond correctly at any point, reset and start over in the middle of the screen. A good training set when starting out, do this 20 health-bars worth from left side and right side.,

Side note: Bison, Blanka, Cammy, Chun-Li, Ryu still have OG drive rush where shimmy after s.LP can be done.
